# Print Layout Planner

Print Layout Planner helps you split large-format artwork into home‑printer friendly sheets. Design the layout visually, pack pieces efficiently, preview textures in place, and export a ready-to-print PDF that only includes the pages you actually need.

## Features

- Choose standard paper sizes (A-series, US Letter/Tabloid) and configure a multi-sheet grid in portrait or landscape.
- Add print objects with real-world dimensions in millimetres, centimetres, or inches.
- Attach optional textures or reference artwork to each object, then drag to arrange them across the canvas.
- Run the built-in optimiser to minimise waste by packing objects tightly without overlaps.
- Export a trimmed PDF: every sheet shows only the portion of each object that lands on it, and blank pages are skipped automatically.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# Check production build
npm run build
```

The app is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. When developing, open the local URL reported by `npm run dev`. After you arrange objects and textures to your liking, use “Export PDF” in the UI to generate print-ready pages that can be sent straight to your printer (ensure print scaling is set to 100% / actual size). Enjoy planning your next tiled print or cosplay prop!***
